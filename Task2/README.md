Task 2 – Simple Calculator

## Overview ##
This project is a basic command-line calculator built using Python. It allows the user to enter two numbers, choose an arithmetic operation, and then see the result. The goal is to practice taking user input, performing calculations, and displaying output.

## Features ##
