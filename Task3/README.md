Task 3 – Password Generator

## Overview ##
This project is a command-line Password Generator built using Python. It allows the user to choose a password length and select a complexity level, then generates a random password based on that choice. The goal is to practice loops, user input, conditional statements, and randomization in Python.

## Features ##
~ User can enter desired password length

~ Three complexity levels:

1.Letters only

2.Letters and numbers

3.Letters, numbers, and symbols

~ Input validation for:

1.Password length

2.Menu choice

~ Generates a new password instantly

~ Option to exit the program

## How It Works ##
1.The program asks the user for the password length.

2.The user selects the complexity level.

3.Based on the choice, a set of characters is selected.

4.A random password is generated and displayed.

5.The program repeats until the user chooses to exit.

## Requirements ##
~ Python 3 installed on your system

~ random and string modules (these come built-in with Python)

## How to Run ##
1.Open the 'Task3' folder

2.Open a terminal or command prompt

3.Run the command: python task3.py

4.Follow the on-screen instructions.

## Notes ##
~ Longer passwords are generally more secure.

~ The program runs in a loop, so multiple passwords can be generated in one session.

~ No external libraries are required.
