Task 1 – To-Do List Application

## Overview ##
This project is a command-line based To-Do List application built using Python. It helps users manage and organize their tasks by allowing them to create, update, and track their tasks efficiently.

## Features ##
1.Add new tasks
2.View all tasks
3.Update an existing task
4.Mark a task as completed
5.Delete a task
6.Track task status (Pending / Done)

## How It Works ##
The program stores tasks in a list while it is running. Each task has:
~ A title
~ A status (Pending or Done)
The user can choose options from a menu to manage their tasks.

## Requirements ##
~ Python installed on your system (Python 3 recommended)

## How to Run ##
1.Open the 'Task1' folder 
2.Open a terminal or command prompt
3.Run the command: python task1.py
4.Use the menu options (1–6) to manage your tasks.

## Notes ##
A.Tasks are stored only while the program is running. When the program closes, the list resets.
B.This project focuses on a simple command-line interface for learning basic Python concepts.
